Which of the following is a type of intangible business property that is protected by law:</h5><select class="select-style" id="_1"><option value="def" disabled selected>Select</option><option value="A">A. Equipment</option><option value="B">B. Inventory</option><option value="C">C. Acreage</option><option value="D">D. Trademark</option></select></br></br><div id="1answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is D: Trademark</h5><h5>A trademark is a symbol, design, or word used by a business to identify a good or service
and is registered with the government to prevent its use by others. A trademark is an example of
intangible business property. Federal law protects a business's intangible property from being used by
competitors. A business's inventory, acreage, and equipment are types of tangible property.
</h5></div><h5 id='q2'>2. When filing a tort against a business, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant</h5><select class="select-style" id="_2"><option value="def" disabled selected>Select</option><option value="A">A. damaged property intentionally.</option><option value="B">B. breached the duty of care.</option><option value="C">C. conspired with a competitor.</option><option value="D">D. violated the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</option></select></br></br><div id="2answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is B: breached the duty of care.</h5><h5>The duty of care is the basic principle that expects all individuals and
businesses to exhibit socially responsible behavior by using caution to prevent harm and by watching out
for one another. A tort is a private wrongdoing that potentially harms another person or entity. If a
business or one of its employees breaches the duty of care, the business may be held liable for the tort.
However, the plaintiff must have grounds or proof that establishes that the business or its employee
(defendant) has committed a wrongful act, thereby breaching the duty of care. Intentional damage and
conspiring with a competitor (collusion) are types of torts. The doctrine of sovereign immunity is the
universally accepted principle that each nation has the right to manage its own government and develop
its own laws.
</h5></div><h5 id='q3'>3. Which of the following is an example of a voluntary debtor-creditor relationship:</h5><select class="select-style" id="_3"><option value="def" disabled selected>Select</option><option value="A">A. Requiring specific information</option><option value="B">B. Receiving a monetary gift</option><option value="C">C. Obtaining a loan from a bank</option><option value="D">D. Owing punitive damages</option></select></br></br><div id="3answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is C: Obtaining a loan from a bank</h5><h5>The debtor is the individual or business that owes money to another
individual or business, which is the creditor. A business that obtains a loan from a bank is entering into a
voluntary debtor-creditor relationship. It is voluntary because the business (debtor) is seeking to obtain
funds from the bank (creditor) by going through a loan-application process. A monetary gift is given
without expectations of repayment. A monetary gift and a request for information are not examples of
debtor-creditor relationships. In tort cases, the court can order one party to pay punitive damages to the
other party. This is an example of an involuntary debtor-creditor relationship.
</h5></div><h5 id='q4'>4. Chris purchased 500 shares of microcap HRR stock. Then, he posted false information about HRR on
several investment websites to hype up the stock. After driving up the price of HRR stock, Chris quickly
sold all of his stock in the company and earned a large profit. The price of the stock then fell, leaving
HRR investors with worthless stock. What type of investment scam did Chris commit?</h5><select class="select-style" id="_4"><option value="def" disabled selected>Select</option><option value="A">A. Phishing</option><option value="B">B. Pyramid scheme</option><option value="C">C. Ponzi scheme</option><option value="D">D. Pump and dump</option></select></br></br><div id="4answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is D: Pump and dump</h5><h5>Pump and dump is an investment scam that takes place mostly online. It typically
involves scammers who buy a small stock and then hype it up to other investors, causing its price to rise.
The scammers sell when the price is high, leaving the victims to deal with the rapid price decline
afterwards. A pyramid scheme is an illegal form of multi-level marketing in which emphasis is placed on
collecting initial fees from as many people as possible. A Ponzi scheme is an investment scam that lures
in new investors by promising high rates of return with little to no risk. Phishing is an online identity-theft
scam that fools its victims into believing they are submitting sensitive, personal information (such as
credit card numbers or bank passwords) to a legitimate website.
</h5></div><h5 id='q5'>5. Which of the following statements best describes the taxation of Roth IRAs:</h5><select class="select-style" id="_5"><option value="def" disabled selected>Select</option><option value="A">A. Contributions and withdrawals during retirement are both taxed.</option><option value="B">B. Contributions are tax deductible, but withdrawals during retirement are taxed.</option><option value="C">C. Contributions are taxed, but withdrawals during retirement are not.</option><option value="D">D. Contributions and withdrawals during retirement are tax deductible.</option></select></br></br><div id="5answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is C: Contributions are taxed, but withdrawals during retirement are not.</h5><h5>Contributions paid into Roth Individual
Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are taxed. But, earnings on the growing funds in the account and
withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. Unlike Roth IRAs, contributions to traditional IRAs are tax
deductible, but investors must pay taxes on the withdrawals they make from these accounts during
retirement.
</h5></div><h5 id='q6'>6. Compliance in the finance industry involves financial institutions operating within</h5><select class="select-style" id="_6"><option value="def" disabled selected>Select</option><option value="A">A. specific territories.</option><option value="B">B. regulatory guidelines.</option><option value="C">C. organizational plans.</option><option value="D">D. different relationships.</option></select></br></br><div id="6answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is B: regulatory guidelines.</h5><h5>Financial institutions are required to follow governmental rules and regulations.
Following these regulatory guidelines is the process of compliance. The purpose of compliance is to
make the industry safe for consumers and to maintain the stability of the financial system. Compliance
does not involve operating within specific territories, organization plans, or different relationships.
</h5></div><h5 id='q7'>7. In general, a governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) software system identifies and measures risk;
monitors the risk-management system; routinely checks adherence to company-wide policies; and
ensures compliance with</h5><select class="select-style" id="_7"><option value="def" disabled selected>Select</option><option value="A">A. reporting requirements.</option><option value="B">B. union demands.</option><option value="C">C. product standards.</option><option value="D">D. contingency plans.</option></select></br></br><div id="7answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is A: reporting requirements.</h5><h5>Demand for governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) software systems has
grown significantly in recent years. Although GRC software can be customized to better meet individual
business needs, it serves four basic functions. It identifies and measures corporate risk levels; monitors
the risk-management system; checks to see that employees are adhering to company-wide policies; and
ensures compliance with reporting requirements enforced by federal and state government agencies and
other regulatory commissions. It is not designed to ensure compliance with union demands, product
standards, or contingency plans.
</h5></div><h5 id='q8'>8. While conducting a staff meeting, the speaker noticed that Colin was texting on his smartphone. Colin's
nonverbal behavior indicates that he was</h5><select class="select-style" id="_8"><option value="def" disabled selected>Select</option><option value="A">A. distracted.</option><option value="B">B. annoyed.</option><option value="C">C. listening to the speaker.</option><option value="D">D. interested in the topic.

®
</option></select></br></br><div id="8answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is A: distracted.</h5><h5>Nonverbal cues are the elements of communication that involve gestures and facial
expressions rather than words. Nonverbal cues often express what the senders and recipients think
about their messages. If Colin was interested in the meeting topic or was listening to the speaker, he
would be directing his attention to the speaker. Since Colin was looking at his phone and texting, he was
distracted and was probably not paying attention to what the speaker was saying. The speaker likely felt
that Colin's nonverbal behavior was rude and inconsiderate. There is not enough information to
determine if Colin was annoyed.
</h5></div><h5 id='q9'>9. Before DiAnn presents her new idea to her boss, she searches the Internet and jots down two statistics
that reinforce the idea. This is an example of</h5><select class="select-style" id="_9"><option value="def" disabled selected>Select</option><option value="A">A. obtaining primary information.</option><option value="B">B. supporting ideas with evidence.</option><option value="C">C. giving alternative ideas.</option><option value="D">D. clarifying a new idea.</option></select></br></br><div id="9answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is B: supporting ideas with evidence.</h5><h5>Ideas that are evidence-based are more easily accepted than those that
are not. Primary information is new information collected for the issue at hand. DiAnn is collecting
secondary information, which involves obtaining information that has already been collected by others.
The evidence does not create alternative ideas. It is meant to add validation to the original idea.
Clarifying an idea involves explaining it in more detail.
</h5></div><h5 id='q10'>10. At work, Bob is assigned to be on a team of five people that will create a new product. Which action can
Bob take to participate in the team in a useful way?</h5><select class="select-style" id="_10"><option value="def" disabled selected>Select</option><option value="A">A.

Find out what other people in the group know about the product</option><option value="D">D. Walk around the room during discussions to keep energy in the group</option></select></br></br><div id="10answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is C: Find out what other people in the group know about the product</h5><h5>Starting a meeting by learning about
others' knowledge of the subject identifies what your team knows—as well as areas where more work will
be needed. Some ground rules are needed to let everyone know how the group operates. Otherwise,
unacceptable behavior may occur. Unusual ideas should not be avoided. Often these are the
breakthroughs that lead to success. Bob should use good listening skills, including making eye contact
and using other nonverbal cues, to let others in the group know he is listening.
</h5></div><h5 id='q11'>11. Alma is preparing a presentation about her department's budget to make to the company president. She
wants to use a visual representation of the budget that shows parts in relation to the whole. Alma should
consider using a</h5><select class="select-style" id="_11"><option value="def" disabled selected>Select</option><option value="A">A. table.</option><option value="B">B. pie chart.</option><option value="C">C. line graph.</option><option value="D">D. bar graph.</option></select></br></br><div id="11answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is B: pie chart.</h5><h5>If Alma wants to illustrate her budget by showing parts in relation to the whole, she should use
a pie chart. A table is a visual way of displaying information in rows and columns. A bar graph shows
values across categories. Line graphs usually depict information over time. Although Alma might want to
use these types of graphics for other parts of her presentation, the pie chart is the best way to show how
the parts of her budget add up to form the whole.
</h5></div><h5 id='q12'>12. What type of letter should a business include when sending copies of a contract to a vendor?</h5><select class="select-style" id="_12"><option value="def" disabled selected>Select</option><option value="A">A. Request</option><option value="B">B. Acknowledgment</option><option value="C">C. Claim</option><option value="D">D. Transmittal</option></select></br></br><div id="12answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is D: Transmittal</h5><h5>A transmittal letter should always accompany important business papers, such as contracts,
that are sent by mail. The purpose of the transmittal letter is to let the recipient know exactly what should
be contained in the package and if the recipient needs to take any action. A transmittal letter
accompanying contracts should indicate how many copies are included and if the recipient needs to sign
and return a copy. An acknowledgment letter acknowledges the receipt of business papers. A claim letter
requests a solution to a problem. A request letter asks for information.
</h5></div><h5 id='q13'>13. Identify the type of appeal used in the following persuasive message: "This new book is written by Dr.
Juliet Browne, who holds a doctorate from the Harvard School of Medicine and is the Chair of the World
Health Organization."</h5><select class="select-style" id="_13"><option value="def" disabled selected>Select</option><option value="A">A. Emotions</option><option value="B">B. Reason</option><option value="C">C. Credibility</option><option value="D">D. Shock value</option></select></br></br><div id="13answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is C: Credibility</h5><h5>Credibility is achieved when the audience has confidence in the persuader. In this case, Dr.
Browne's prestigious job title and degree lead the audience to believe she is a credible source. Reason is
when logic is used to persuade someone to do something. It often involves solid facts and statistics. An
emotional appeal affects the audience's feelings, such as sympathy or love. An appeal that uses shock
value is a form of an emotional appeal that includes information that the audience would find shocking.
</h5></div><h5 id='q14'>14. What is a type of informal communication that coworkers often use to communicate with each other?</h5><select class="select-style" id="_14"><option value="def" disabled selected>Select</option><option value="A">A. Network</option><option value="B">B. Feedback</option><option value="C">C. Grapevine</option><option value="D">D. Structured</option></select></br></br><div id="14answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is C: Grapevine</h5><h5>Grapevine is an oral communication method in which information is passed around the
company but not formally announced or verified. Coworkers frequently discuss company issues and pass
on information from one department to another through the grapevine. Employees often obtain
information and communicate it to others through the grapevine before management makes an official
announcement. Feedback is evaluative information given by supervisors to employees. Network is a
system of contacts within and outside the organization. Structured is formal communication.
</h5></div><h5 id='q15'>15.

Builds positive relationships with customers</option><option value="D">D. Encourages employees to be aggressive</option></select></br></br><div id="15answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is C: Builds positive relationships with customers</h5><h5>A service orientation is the business philosophy of providing
quality service. One way to do this is to communicate effectively with customers so they trust the
business. The benefit of creating trust by providing accurate and credible information is that it tends to
build positive relationships with customers. Customers often remain loyal to a business if they have
confidence that the business will treat them well and provide quality service. The purpose of reinforcing
service orientation through communication is not to promote the sale of new products, reward customers
for their support, or encourage employees to be aggressive.
</h5></div><h5 id='q16'>16. When Mr. Schwarz's order did not arrive at the expected time, he called Karl, the salesperson with whom
he had placed his order. Karl apologized for the delay and told Mr. Schwarz that he would check into the
issue. After Karl talked with the transportation company, he immediately called Mr. Schwarz to let him
know where the order was and when to expect delivery. Mr. Schwarz thanked Karl for getting back with
him so quickly. In this situation, Karl reinforced the company's image by</h5><select class="select-style" id="_16"><option value="def" disabled selected>Select</option><option value="A">A. delegating work tasks.</option><option value="B">B. giving vague answers.</option><option value="C">C. providing efficient follow-up.</option><option value="D">D. complimenting the customer.

</option></select></br></br><div id="16answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is C: providing efficient follow-up.</h5><h5>Customers often base their impressions of a business on the interactions
they have with the business's employees. In the situation provided, Karl worked quickly to find out the
status of the order and immediately called Mr. Schwarz with specific information about where the order
was and when to expect delivery. This is an example of efficient follow-up. By providing efficient service,
Karl is building favorable relationships with customers. There is not enough information provided to
determine if Karl delegated work tasks to facilitate his follow-up activities or if he complimented Mr.
Schwarz.

The correct answer is D: Aligning business activities with customer needs</h5><h5>A customer-centric business focuses on customer
needs and wants. To focus on the customers' needs and wants, the business must ensure that its
business objectives and activities align with its customers' needs and wants. A customer-centric business
must continuously improve its processes and products to accommodate its customers' changing needs
and wants. The business cannot be satisfied with the status quo. A customer-centric business allows its
employees to provide input and make decisions in relation to customer relationships. Touch points are all
of the opportunities that businesses have to connect with customers and reinforce their brand value. A
customer-centric business is not likely to reduce the number of customer touch points.

The correct answer is D: simple explanations.</h5><h5>When providing product information to clients, finance professionals should keep
the clients' point of view in mind. Clients may not be familiar with finance industry jargon, technical terms,
or acronyms. Therefore, finance professionals should use simple, clear language that clients understand.
While standard responses are sometimes helpful to finance professionals, it is usually better to keep
individual clients in mind when providing product information since different clients are likely to have
different knowledge bases.
</h5></div><h5 id='q19'>19. Beverly, the new office manager, just completed a review of the last two years of accounts receivable
data. In doing so, she discovered that there are erroneous duplicate entries totaling $25,628 in the
system. Unfortunately, due to these duplicate entries, collection letters were sent to many customers who
had already paid in full—customers who are angry with the company for sending them the letters. What
should Beverly do to try to save these customer relationships and ensure that these customers are not
bothered in the future?</h5><select class="select-style" id="_19"><option value="def" disabled selected>Select</option><option value="A">A.

Complete a data cleansing of the erroneous entries</option><option value="D">D. Use funds from the accounts payable account to pay the debt</option></select></br></br><div id="19answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is C: Complete a data cleansing of the erroneous entries</h5><h5>One of the quickest ways for a business to upset its
customers is to accuse them of failing to pay their bills—especially when the business has already
received payment from them. To ensure that these customers do not receive more erroneous collection
letters in the future, Beverly should complete a data cleansing of the erroneous entries, removing them
from the system. Completing an accounting software update isn't likely to have an effect on the
erroneous entries. While it might be helpful to contact each customer by phone and apologize, Beverly
needs to do more than that to ensure that the customers are not bothered in the future. The $25,628 is
not a debt. It is the sum total of all the erroneous duplicate entries in the accounts receivable account.

The correct answer is B: consumption.</h5><h5>Everyone consumes goods and services to satisfy unlimited wants. Production, exchange,

services. Exchange involves the exchange of money payments between producers and the owners of
resources. Distribution examines how money payments are divided or distributed between resource
owners and producers.

Red apples @ $1.20 per pound; green apples @ $1.60 per pound</option></select></br></br><div id="21answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is B: Red apples @ $0.90 per pound; green apples @ $0.80 per pound</h5><h5>This is the only combination that
resulted in a change in the relative price ratio. When red apples sold for $0.30 per pound and green
apples for $0.40 per pound, the price of each was cut in half, and the ratio remained the same. When red
apples sold for $1.20 per pound and green apples for $1.60 per pound, the price of each was doubled
and the ratio remained the same. When red apples sold for $0.45 per pound and green apples for $0.60,
the price of each was cut one-fourth, and the ratio remained the same.

The correct answer is D: marketing.</h5><h5>Marketing is a primary business activity that involves creating, communicating, and delivering
value to customers and managing customer relationships in ways that benefit the organization and its
stakeholders. Marketing is an important business activity because it identifies what consumers want and
plans how to promote and sell those goods and services to the consumers. Management is the process
of planning, organizing, directing, and controlling business activities to achieve objectives. Production is
the process or activity of producing goods and services wanted by consumers. Risk management is the
business activity that involves the planning, controlling, preventing, and procedures involved in limiting
business losses. It optimizes the relationship of potential loss to gain.

The correct answer is A: It is a combination of two other organizational structures.</h5><h5>The matrix organizational structure is a
combination of the functional structure and the divisional structure. It includes traditional departments, but
it is also broken down by division (including, but not limited to, product lines). As organizational design

</option></select></br></br><div id="24answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is A: systems thinking.</h5><h5>Systems thinking is an organizational learning concept that focuses on the big picture
rather than seeing smaller, individual parts. Team learning means thinking and working together as a
group. Shared organizational vision refers to sharing a mutual commitment to the future the firm seeks to
create. Personal mastery is striving for individual learning as a means of advancing the organization.

For example, the level of productivity in the United States has given the country a wealth of goods and
services which allows its citizens to reach a certain standard of living. Gross domestic product is the final,
total value of all goods and services produced within a country's geographic boundaries during a year's
time. GDP serves as a measure of economic growth.

The correct answer is D: a lower rate of inflation.</h5><h5>When a lot of people are out of work, they lose their buying power, which means
less money is in circulation. Because unemployed people have less disposable income, the demand for
goods and services is low, which tends to slow or lower the rate of inflation (rise in prices). The amount of
monetary policies that the government establishes does not affect unemployment rates. When the GDP
grows, an economic expansion is occurring, which indicates that people and businesses are spending
money and the unemployment levels are low.

The correct answer is D: gender.</h5><h5>A stereotype is a set image or assumption about a person or thing. When people stereotype
others, they tend to classify certain people as a group that possesses certain characteristics. These
characteristics are often based on distorted beliefs or unreliable information. A person who stereotypes
others often fails to see an individual who possesses unique skills, values, and attitudes. Gender is one
characteristic by which people often stereotype others. Assuming men are more assertive than women in
business situations is a distorted belief. In fact, many women are very assertive in business situations.
Ethnic stereotyping involves having false beliefs about a person on the basis of his/her race or culture.
Stereotypes about religion involve having distorted beliefs about a person's spiritual practices. An
individual who stereotypes by age might feel that younger people do not possess needed knowledge or
that older people are feeble and lack adaptability.

The correct answer is B: enthusiastic.</h5><h5>Self-confidence is a positive belief in your own talents, skills, and objectives. When people
are positive and believe in themselves, they usually are enthusiastic and display great interest or
excitement in what they do. Confident people have a good attitude and display that attitude by being
enthusiastic. Individuals do not necessarily exhibit self-confidence by being creative, emotional, or
reserved.

The correct answer is D: it prevents Maureen from hearing the criticism clearly.</h5><h5>Defensiveness raises a barrier between you and
the speaker. Most of us feel angry or resentful when we are criticized, especially when the criticism is
unjust. However, we cannot afford to exhibit this kind of attitude on the job. If Maureen listened with an
open mind to the supervisor, she might learn not only how to correct her mistakes but how to avoid the
mistakes in the future. Maureen's attitude indicates immaturity rather than a desire to call attention to
herself.

The correct answer is B: Leaving the room when a salesperson takes a telephone call</h5><h5>Successful employees realize the
importance of respecting others' privacy in the workplace. When employees respect others' privacy, they
are likely to gain the trust and respect of coworkers and managers. An employee who respects others'
privacy would leave the room when a coworker (e.g., salesperson) takes a telephone call. Speaking up
for a coworker, providing feedback, and answering a coworker's phone call are not necessarily situations
in which privacy is being violated; there is not enough information provided to determine if intervention
was requested.

</option></select></br></br><div id="33answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is A: damage their relationships.</h5><h5>Insecure people are often anxious about their interpersonal relationships.
They are afraid if they become assertive, they may ruin a friendship or end a relationship. Assertiveness
is a risk they are unwilling to take. These people are dependent rather than independent and may
already be considered childish because of their passive behavior that focuses on pleasing others.

The correct answer is D: explaining how they will benefit.</h5><h5>People tend to work harder to achieve a vision or goal if they understand
how they will benefit. Therefore, a leader should explain the benefits they will receive so employees will
be encouraged to work toward a shared vision. Simply describing the objective or reviewing the new
assignment will not encourage employees to work unless they also understand how they will benefit.
Generating a profit is a benefit to the business that will not necessarily encourage employees to work
unless they will share in the profit.

The correct answer is C: how long your money is invested.</h5><h5>The most important factors to consider in compounding growth are
how much money you invest, how much your investment grows each year, and how long your money is
invested. Investing is using money to make money, which means that if you invest money in the stock
market, for example, you are likely to make an average of 10 percent each year. As the years pass, your
investment will grow tremendously because you will be earning interest on interest. So, it is beneficial to
invest for as long as possible to earn the largest amount of compound interest as possible. How you earn
the money that you invest, your educational background and career, and your mutual fund manager's
education have a much smaller impact on compounding growth than time does.

name and personal information (e.g. credit cards) for fraudulent purposes. The first thing Cameron
should do when he realizes he has lost his wallet is to cancel his credit cards. By canceling the credit
cards, Cameron will protect himself in the event that someone finds his wallet and attempts to use the
credit cards. Financial institutions and businesses (e.g., retailers) issue credit cards, not government
agencies. Cameron should contact the proper law enforcement authorities (e.g., police) if he thinks his
wallet is stolen. He can report a lost wallet, and he can also change the passwords for his online banking
accounts. However, the first thing he should do is to cancel his credit and debit cards.

Gross Domestic Product, unemployment, and inflation.</option></select></br></br><div id="45answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is D: Gross Domestic Product, unemployment, and inflation.</h5><h5>According to most analysts, the three economic
indicators that impact the stock market the most (and, therefore, the three that stock market investors
and traders should pay the closest attention to) are the Gross Domestic Product, unemployment, and
inflation. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the final market value of the total output of all goods and
services produced within a country's geographic boundaries during a year's time. The stock market
mirrors the GDP—if the GDP goes up, the stock market usually goes up with it. The unemployment rate
is the percentage of the workforce that is unemployed. The stock market is inversely related to the
unemployment rate—if the unemployment rate goes up, stock prices usually go down. Inflation is a rapid
rise in prices that may occur when demand exceeds supply or when productivity declines and costs of
labor go up. If inflation and interest rates both rise, the stock market will suffer. However, if inflation goes
up while interest rates stay low, the stock market is likely to benefit. Overhead expenses and bond rates
are not economic indicators.

instruments or market indices. Investors frequently use derivatives to hedge or reduce the risk of
investing in the foreign exchange market, which is sometimes volatile. The derivatives help to reduce the
impact of significant fluctuations in foreign exchange markets. Emerging markets are financial markets in
countries with developing economies. Emerging markets are usually receptive to foreign investment, but
they are also more volatile and risky than financial markets in developed countries. Venture capital is
invested money that is used for new business opportunities. No-load mutual funds have no up-front sales

liabilities section also indicates the shareholders' equity, which is the value of all the outstanding stock
owned by shareholders. Shareholders' equity is determined by subtracting the liabilities from the assets.
The income statement, also known as the profit-and-loss statement, shows a company's profitability over
a specific period of time. The cash flow statement tracks the money that comes into and flows out of a

This eliminates the need for the business to handle checks, fill out deposit slips, and send the checks to
the bank for processing. The cash is available immediately, and the business does not need to wait for a
check to be processed before it can access the funds. The use of electronic funds transfer to collect

accounting often summarizes information about the business's day-to-day financial activities, such as
sales transactions (accounts receivable) and the monies the business owes others (accounts payable).
Financial accounting focuses on capturing, maintaining, preparing, and reporting financial information to
external audiences. Examples of financial accounting activities include preparing tax data for the
government and developing the annual report for the business's stakeholders. The annual report usually
contains information about the business's long-term investment goals.

analysis involves the calculation of ratios based on a company's financial data. It allows analysts to
compare numbers within a financial statement and determine the relationships among numbers on
different financial statements. It can also be used to compare the performance of multiple companies.

business's balance sheet:</h5><select class="select-style" id="_58"><option value="def" disabled selected>Select</option><option value="A">A. Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity</option><option value="B">B. Owner's Equity = Available Cash - Liabilities</option><option value="C">C. Assets = Owner's Equity - Liabilities</option><option value="D">D. Owner's Equity = Liabilities + Available Cash

</option></select></br></br><div id="58answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is A: Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity</h5><h5>A balance sheet is a financial statement that captures the financial
condition of the business at that particular moment. Three main elements are included on the balance
sheet—assets, liabilities, and owner's equity. Available cash is one part of the business's total assets. If
the assets do not equal the liabilities when the liabilities are added to the owner's equity (Assets =
Liabilities + Owner's Equity), information on the balance sheet is incorrect.
</h5></div><h5 id='q59'>59. You want to have $8,000 in three years to purchase a car. You can earn 4% compound interest on your

The correct answer is B: $7,111.75</h5><h5>To determine how much you should invest today, calculate the present value of your
Number of Years
investment using the formula Present Value = Future Value / (1 + Interest Rate)
. So, the
3
present value of your investment is equal to $8,000 / (1 + 0.04) . To solve this equation, first add one to
the interest rate (1 + 0.04 = 1.04). Next, raise this sum to the third power, which is the same as
3
multiplying the sum by itself three times (1.04 = 1.04 X 1.04 X 1.04 = 1.1249). Finally, divide the future
value of your investment by this product ($8,000 / 1.1249 = $7,111.75). To have $8,000 in three years,
you need to invest $7,111.75 today.

data are presented as information to businesspeople to evaluate and to make business decisions. In
order for businesspeople to make sound business decisions, the financial data must be accurate, current,
and relevant. Making a decision based on incorrect or outdated data could be very costly to a business.
Businesses use project-management software to track projects. Businesses implement effective
financial-information management processes to be in compliance with government regulations.
Businesses evaluate, rather than revise, economic indicators.

A lack of risk</option></select></br></br><div id="77answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is B: Poorly defined goals</h5><h5>Poorly defined project goals are one of the many challenges that project managers
routinely face. A surplus of resources would be a good thing, as would a lack of risk! Laws and
regulations may affect business projects, but they typically don't pose a challenge.
</h5></div><h5 id='q78'>78. What project-planning tool helps businesses to effectively plan and use time?</h5><select class="select-style" id="_78"><option value="def" disabled selected>Select</option><option value="A">A. Policies</option><option value="B">B. Objectives</option><option value="C">C. Schedules</option><option value="D">D. Guidelines</option></select></br></br><div id="78answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is C: Schedules</h5><h5>When planning a project, businesses often develop schedules to identify what tasks need to
be done and how long it will take to perform those tasks. The use of schedules helps a business to
organize work and establish completion dates to make sure the work is done on time. Scheduling an
effective use of time helps a business to achieve the objectives, or goals, of the project. Policies are
guidelines that businesses follow when making decisions about projects. Objectives, policies, and
guidelines are other project-planning tools, but they do not involve planning the use of time.
</h5></div><h5 id='q79'>79. Which of the following is NOT a benefit of a post-implementation review?</h5><select class="select-style" id="_79"><option value="def" disabled selected>Select</option><option value="A">A.

Identifying cost-savings opportunities for the current project</option><option value="D">D. Identifying ways to improve the company's processes</option></select></br></br><div id="79answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is C: Identifying cost-savings opportunities for the current project</h5><h5>A post-implementation review is conducted
after a project is finished. Therefore, there is not an opportunity to save money on the current project.
There is an opportunity to identify ways to improve future projects, such as cost-savings measures,
improving project planning methods, and improving the processes used by the company.
</h5></div><h5 id='q80'>80. Purchasing is important to international businesses because</h5><select class="select-style" id="_80"><option value="def" disabled selected>Select</option><option value="A">A. supplies should be delivered in a timely fashion.</option><option value="B">B. good relations with vendors reduce prices.</option><option value="C">C. quality standards should be maintained.</option><option value="D">D. controlling costs increases competitiveness.</option></select></br></br><div id="80answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is D: controlling costs increases competitiveness.</h5><h5>Effective purchasing controls costs, which enables
businesses to lower selling prices. For example, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan can often produce for
less. American companies must reduce costs to be competitive in such world markets. Good relations
with vendors and suppliers are important but do not reduce prices. Maintaining quality standards is a
production goal.
</h5></div><h5 id='q81'>81. An advantage to businesses of using quality control methods is that these methods often</h5><select class="select-style" id="_81"><option value="def" disabled selected>Select</option><option value="A">A. involve time.</option><option value="B">B. reduce costs.</option><option value="C">C. increase waste.</option><option value="D">D. require directions.</option></select></br></br><div id="81answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is B: reduce costs.</h5><h5>It is often more costly not to provide quality than to use methods to increase quality. If
businesses develop a reputation of providing low quality goods and services, they may lose customers,
which is costly. Therefore, it is to the business's advantage to use quality control methods so the work
will be done correctly rather than spend money to correct mistakes, handle customer complaints, and find
new customers. Using quality control methods involves time, but it is time well spent to reduce the cost of
correcting mistakes. Using quality control methods usually decreases waste. Some quality control
methods might require directions which could be a disadvantage.
</h5></div><h5 id='q82'>82. An organization with a quality culture would have executive-level managers who are</h5><select class="select-style" id="_82"><option value="def" disabled selected>Select</option><option value="A">A. flexible, indifferent, and not responsible for quality.</option><option value="B">B. good at delegating all commitments for quality assurance.</option><option value="C">C. committed and involved and take responsibility for quality.</option><option value="D">D. able to enlist the expertise of outside contractors for quality.</option></select></br></br><div id="82answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is C: committed and involved and take responsibility for quality.</h5><h5>Executive-level managers are both committed
and involved. They take responsibility for quality and do not delegate that responsibility. This is a
characteristic shared by organizations with a quality culture. The alternatives remove the responsibility for
quality from the executive-level manager and delegate it to others.

The correct answer is C: self-esteem.</h5><h5>Self-esteem is the regard or respect that you have for yourself. People who have selfesteem understand themselves and like who they are. Social acceptance involves being accepted by
others. Safety is associated with personal security and protection from harm. Self-fulfillment involves
personal growth, achievement, and reaching one's fullest potential.

The correct answer is B: corporate finance.</h5><h5>Diana's job preparing bills and invoices for her company is in the area of corporate
finance. The corporate finance function in a company is to manage policy and strategy for (and the
implementation of) capital structure, budgeting, acquisition and investment, financial modeling and
planning, funding, dividends, and taxation. Diana's career is not in the area of marketing
communications, securities and investments, or professional selling. Marketing communications involves
marketing activities that inform, remind, and/or persuade the targeted audience of ideas, experiences,
goods/services, and/or images. The securities and investments industry consists of brokerage firms,
investment banks, and stock exchanges, all of which support the flow of funds from investors to
companies and institutions. Careers in professional selling involve marketing and management activities
that determine customer needs/wants and respond through planned, personalized communication to
influence purchase decisions and enhance future business operations.

"I wanted to get out of a difficult situation."</option></select></br></br><div id="86answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is B: "I was seeking a more responsible job."</h5><h5>This is a positive response which indicates that the applicant is
interested in getting ahead and is willing to accept additional responsibility. A job applicant should not
make negative remarks about his/her previous employer(s) or coworkers. Even though all of the other
alternatives could be true statements, they are negative and will reflect poorly on the job applicant.

The correct answer is A: underwriter.</h5><h5>The work of underwriters is important to the insurance industry. Underwriters are
responsible for calculating the risk of loss, establishing premium rates, and designing policies to cover
risk. Many choose to specialize in life insurance, health insurance, or property and casualty insurance.
Insurance agents are responsible for selling insurance policies and other financial services. Accountants
are responsible for preparing, analyzing, and verifying a variety of financial data. Financial analysts
evaluate companies and industries and make recommendations to buy, sell, or hold certain securities.
Financial analysts are also known as securities analysts or investment analysts.

Corporate governance revolves around balancing the desires of the stakeholders in a company.
Corporate governance is not just concerned with the CEO's or vendors' desires; instead, it focuses on the
desires of all stakeholders, including customers, financiers, the community, the government, and
managers. Corporate governance is not necessarily concerned with a company's competitors' desires.

corporation. The board members are elected by the corporation's shareholders. The corporation's chief
executive officer (CEO) reports directly to the board of directors. The vice president of operations is most
likely to report to the CEO. The accounting manager and director of marketing are mid-level managers.
The accounting manager is most likely to report to the vice president of finance, and the director of sales
is most likely to report to the vice president of marketing.

Internship</option></select></br></br><div id="92answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is A: Volunteering</h5><h5>Volunteer work involves donating time without pay to complete tasks or projects. Because
Ryan is tutoring in his free time, he is performing volunteer work. By volunteering to tutor students, Ryan
can determine if he enjoys working with and teaching young children. Participating in these activities may
help Ryan determine if he would like to pursue a career in teaching. Internships involve training in which
schools and businesses cooperate to provide on-the-job practice for learners. Job shadowing involves
observing an individual perform his/her daily job activities in the workplace. An informational interview
involves talking with a business professional about his/her job.

The correct answer is C: implement a referral system.</h5><h5>A referral is a recommendation given to an individual or business by
another individual or business. For example, satisfied clients may refer their friends, family, or colleagues
to their financial planners for financial advice. This is one way that businesspeople working in the
financial industry can build professional relationships. A financial planner may implement a referral
system or program to encourage clients or associates to provide referrals. A referral system might involve
giving a free consultation or discount to a client who has provided the financial planner with a lucrative
referral. Reading about industry trends and printing new business cards are not actions that build
professional relationships. The finance professional must take action on the trends s/he has researched
and distribute the business cards to others to begin building professional relationships. Because financial
information is personal and confidential, people are usually selective with whom they share their
information.
</h5></div><h5 id='q95'>95. To manage potential risks resulting from unethical conduct, many companies build internal infrastructures
that promote and enforce ethical practices. This internal infrastructure is likely to include appropriate audit
procedures, a code of conduct, and a __________ policy.</h5><select class="select-style" id="_95"><option value="def" disabled selected>Select</option><option value="A">A. whistleblower</option><option value="B">B. credit</option><option value="C">C. monetary</option><option value="D">D. constituent</option></select></br></br><div id="95answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is A: whistleblower</h5><h5>One way to manage potential risks resulting from unethical conduct is to build an internal
infrastructure that promotes and enforces ethical practices and offers incentives to behave ethically. This
internal infrastructure typically includes appropriate audit procedures, a code of conduct, a committee to
develop the code, training for employees about the code, and a whistleblower policy. A whistleblower
policy encourages and enables employees to report unethical behavior or actions without fear of negative
repercussions such as demotion or firing. A credit policy is a guideline for a business to follow in
controlling the use of payment plans that allow customers to purchase now and pay later. Monetary
policy is the government policy that determines the amount of money that will be in circulation and the
level of interest rates. Constituent policies are public policies that apply to the government or nation as a
whole. Constituent policies include national security, foreign affairs, diplomacy, etc.

The correct answer is D: contingency plans.</h5><h5>A contingency plan is an alternative course of action. A contingency plan states
specific guidelines that a business uses when responding to undesirable circumstances. Businesses
often use computer software programs to obtain numerical data about their levels of risk in different areas
of the business. They use this information to make business decisions and to help them develop
alternative action plans when circumstances occur that increase or decrease risk at a given time. Content
theories are theories of motivation that focus on internal needs, drives, and incentives that cause people
to behave in a certain manner. An endorsement is approval by a reputable external source. Governments
develop monetary and fiscal regulations. Risk management software programs do not help businesses
develop content theories, endorsement records, and fiscal policies.

Increases the corporation's sales tax liabilities</option><option value="D">D. Eliminates the corporation's state tax liabilities</option></select></br></br><div id="97answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is A: Reduces tax due on the captive's premiums</h5><h5>Even if it is not associated with an insurance company, an
individual company, industry, or association may create a captive insurance company to specifically
protect its parent group(s). The captive insurer aids its parent group(s) by reducing premium expenses,
freeing up capital, and covering risks not commonly addressed by the greater insurance company. In
addition, forming a captive insurance company can reduce, eliminate, or defer federal taxes due on the
corporation's insurance premiums. A captive insurer typically decreases the tax due on a company's loss
reserves. Forming a captive insurance company does not typically increase the corporation's sales tax
liabilities, nor does it eliminate the corporation's state tax liabilities.
</h5></div><h5 id='q98'>98. To control online transactional risks, a business should consider outsourcing its technology needs when it

The correct answer is A: internal expertise.</h5><h5>An important aspect of controlling online risk is making sure that customers'
transactions are secure. Online transactions require customers to provide confidential information (e.g.
credit card numbers), so businesses must have the technological tools and expertise to prevent
unauthorized access to the information. If a business does not have employees with the expertise to work
with this technology, the business should consider hiring a consultant or firm that has the knowledge and
training to handle its technological needs. Outsourcing requires a business to have the money (financial
resources) to pay for the services. Secondary data are facts and figures that have been collected for
purposes other than the project at hand.

</option></select></br></br><div id="99answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is A: most risks are predictable and manageable.</h5><h5>Enterprise risk management is important and helpful
because most business risks are predictable and manageable. If a company can plan for risks, it can
minimize its losses. Although some risks are surprises, most of them are not. Not managing risks can
cause loss of shareholder value. ERM should reduce business costs in the long run by helping a
business avoid or manage risks that could lose money.

</option></select></br></br><div id="100answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is C: To have realistic expectations for workers</h5><h5>Even though managers don't do the actual jobs, it is important
for managers to understand the jobs of the workers they supervise. This helps managers to know how
workers should do the work, to be realistic in the amount of work they expect workers to complete, or
even to fill in when workers are absent or there is an emergency situation of some kind. Managers do not
need to know how to do the work to establish a chain of command. Coordinating employees' efforts and
creating a team spirit are managerial responsibilities that improve the output of workers but are not
related to managers' knowledge of the jobs to be done.
