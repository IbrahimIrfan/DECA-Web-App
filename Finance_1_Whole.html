identifies and compares similar transactions and information. It does not focus on identical transactions

The correct answer is B: $3.25</h5><h5>Marginal cost is the change in cost that occurs when a business increases or decreases
production, and is used to calculate the extra cost of producing one additional item. To determine the
marginal cost of producing each additional hammer, first calculate the change in total cost by subtracting
the total costs before production from the total costs after production began ($62,500 - $56,000 =
$6,500). Therefore, the company's costs increased by $6,500 after it produced 2,000 hammers. To
calculate the marginal cost, divide the change in total cost by the number of hammers ($6,500 ÷ 2,000 =
$3.25).

The correct answer is B: $598.84</h5><h5>Most countries have their own currency. A country's currency value fluctuates in relation to
other countries' currency values. Businesses monitor these fluctuations because dramatic changes in
currency values can affect their profits. To calculate the amount that you would pay in U.S. dollars,
multiply the price of the product in Canadian dollars by the value of the U.S. dollar ($624.60 x .958750 =

an example of __________ in the finance industry.</h5><select class="select-style" id="_39"><option value="def" disabled selected>Select</option><option value="A">A. convergence</option><option value="B">B. consolidation</option><option value="C">C. tactical planning</option><option value="D">D. licensing</option></select></br></br><div id="39answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is A: convergence</h5><h5>Convergence occurs when financial providers from different financial sectors (e.g.,
banking services and insurance) merge. Consolidation takes place when financial providers within the
same institutional category merge. For example, if two banks were to merge, they would be consolidating
their companies. Tactical planning is short-range planning (one year) of specific actions the business will
take. Two businesses should look much further ahead than just one year before making the decision to
merge. Licensing is a business structure that requires the authorization or permission from an owner of
another entity to use trademarked, copyrighted, or patented material for a specific activity, during a
specific time period, for the profit of both parties. Businesses that enter into licensing agreements do not
merge.

The correct answer is B: fall.</h5><h5>The Consumer Price Index measures the prices of consumer goods. In the U.S., it is published
monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, most experts conduct a “year-on-year” comparison
to better understand increases and/or decreases in the CPI. An increase in the CPI signals an increase in
inflation. A sharp increase in inflation causes interest rates and bond values to rise and stock prices to
fall.
</h5></div><h5 id='q42'>42. When nominal Gross National Product (GNP) increases, the money supply typically</h5><select class="select-style" id="_42"><option value="def" disabled selected>Select</option><option value="A">A. decreases.</option><option value="B">B. stays the same.</option><option value="C">C. increases.</option><option value="D">D. fluctuates daily.</option></select></br></br><div id="42answer" style="display: none;"><h5>Incorrect. The correct answer is C: increases.</h5><h5>Nominal GNP (the Gross National Product measured in current prices) and the money supply
are directly related. When nominal GNP increases, the money supply typically increases as well.
Conversely, when nominal GNP goes down, the money supply decreases. And, when the nominal GNP
and the money supply increase, the Federal Reserve typically raises interest rates, too. Since the
nominal GNP is a long-term economic measure, it would not cause the money supply to fluctuate on a
daily basis. Instead, the money supply would increase or decrease over the long term.

The correct answer is A: derivatives.</h5><h5>Derivatives are financial instruments whose value depends upon the value of other financial
instruments or market indices. Investors frequently use derivatives to hedge or reduce the risk of
investing in the foreign exchange market, which is sometimes volatile. The derivatives help to reduce the
impact of significant fluctuations in foreign exchange markets. Emerging markets are financial markets in
countries with developing economies. Emerging markets are usually receptive to foreign investment, but
they are also more volatile and risky than financial markets in developed countries. Venture capital is
invested money that is used for new business opportunities. No-load mutual funds have no up-front sales
charges.

methods and systems over time within an organization. The Normandy Company has applied very similar
accounting methods over its 20 years of operation. Therefore, the company's financial information is
likely to be consistent. However, consistent information is not necessarily comparable, reliable, or
conservative. There is no way of knowing if the company's accounting methods are similar to those of
other businesses in the industry, so the accounting information may not be comparable. Reliable
information is accurate and unbiased. The Normandy Company, though, could easily have inaccurate
financial information, even though it is consistent. Conservative financial information does not overstate
assets and sales or understate liabilities and expenses. There is no indication that the Normandy

The correct answer is A: $1,197.52</h5><h5>Many businesses generate account statements to summarize their customers' purchasing
activities and amounts due for a specific time frame. Because the customer sent a partial payment for a
purchase, the balance due should be added to the next statement. To calculate the balance due, first
subtract the amount paid from the original purchase amount ($2,456.29 - $1,725 = $731.29). Then, add
this figure to the total of the most recent purchases ($731.29 + $466.23 = $1,197.52). The customer
owes Webster $1,197.52.

place within an organization. Jane attempted to resolve a potential problem internally with her manager,
but needed to go outside her organization to get the problem resolved. Countries, such as the U.S. and
Canada, have whistleblower laws that protect whistleblowers from retaliation. Attempting to ensure the
safety of others is not being a tattle tale—it is being a responsible adult. Because it can be interpreted be
some people as tattling, whistleblower laws may be used to protect the person who reports
noncompliance. Jane is attempting to prevent an accident; one has not occurred, yet. Security
procedures are set in place by a company's management. Jane is reporting noncompliance that may
result in a company's deciding to establish new security procedures.
