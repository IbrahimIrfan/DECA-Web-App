Which of the following is a type of intangible business property that is protected by law:</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Equipment</opition><option>B. Inventory</opition><option>C. Acreage</opition><option>D. Trademark</opition></select></br></br>Correct: D. </br></br>Explanation: undefined</br></br></br>2. When filing a tort against a business, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. damaged property intentionally.</opition><option>B. breached the duty of care.</opition><option>C. conspired with a competitor.</opition><option>D. violated the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: B. </br></br>Explanation: The duty of care is the basic principle that expects all individuals and
businesses to exhibit socially responsible behavior by using caution to prevent harm and by watching out
for one another. A tort is a private wrongdoing that potentially harms another person or entity. If a
business or one of its employees breaches the duty of care, the business may be held liable for the tort.
However, the plaintiff must have grounds or proof that establishes that the business or its employee
(defendant) has committed a wrongful act, thereby breaching the duty of care. Intentional damage and
conspiring with a competitor (collusion) are types of torts. The doctrine of sovereign immunity is the
universally accepted principle that each nation has the right to manage its own government and develop
its own laws.
</br></br></br>3. Which of the following is an example of a voluntary debtor-creditor relationship:</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Requiring specific information</opition><option>B. Receiving a monetary gift</opition><option>C. Obtaining a loan from a bank</opition><option>D. Owing punitive damages</opition></select></br></br>Correct: C. </br></br>Explanation: The debtor is the individual or business that owes money to another
individual or business, which is the creditor. A business that obtains a loan from a bank is entering into a
voluntary debtor-creditor relationship. It is voluntary because the business (debtor) is seeking to obtain
funds from the bank (creditor) by going through a loan-application process. A monetary gift is given
without expectations of repayment. A monetary gift and a request for information are not examples of
debtor-creditor relationships. In tort cases, the court can order one party to pay punitive damages to the
other party. This is an example of an involuntary debtor-creditor relationship.
</br></br></br>4. Chris purchased 500 shares of microcap HRR stock. Then, he posted false information about HRR on
several investment websites to hype up the stock. After driving up the price of HRR stock, Chris quickly
sold all of his stock in the company and earned a large profit. The price of the stock then fell, leaving
HRR investors with worthless stock. What type of investment scam did Chris commit?</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Phishing</opition><option>B. Pyramid scheme</opition><option>C. Ponzi scheme</opition><option>D. Pump and dump</opition></select></br></br>Correct: D. </br></br>Explanation: Pump and dump is an investment scam that takes place mostly online. It typically
involves scammers who buy a small stock and then hype it up to other investors, causing its price to rise.
The scammers sell when the price is high, leaving the victims to deal with the rapid price decline
afterwards. A pyramid scheme is an illegal form of multi-level marketing in which emphasis is placed on
collecting initial fees from as many people as possible. A Ponzi scheme is an investment scam that lures
in new investors by promising high rates of return with little to no risk. Phishing is an online identity-theft
scam that fools its victims into believing they are submitting sensitive, personal information (such as
credit card numbers or bank passwords) to a legitimate website.
</br></br></br>5. Which of the following statements best describes the taxation of Roth IRAs:</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Contributions and withdrawals during retirement are both taxed.</opition><option>B. Contributions are tax deductible, but withdrawals during retirement are taxed.</opition><option>C. Contributions are taxed, but withdrawals during retirement are not.</opition><option>D. Contributions and withdrawals during retirement are tax deductible.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: C. </br></br>Explanation: Contributions paid into Roth Individual
Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are taxed. But, earnings on the growing funds in the account and
withdrawals during retirement are tax-free. Unlike Roth IRAs, contributions to traditional IRAs are tax
deductible, but investors must pay taxes on the withdrawals they make from these accounts during
retirement.
</br></br></br>6. Compliance in the finance industry involves financial institutions operating within</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. specific territories.</opition><option>B. regulatory guidelines.</opition><option>C. organizational plans.</opition><option>D. different relationships.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: B. </br></br>Explanation: Financial institutions are required to follow governmental rules and regulations.
Following these regulatory guidelines is the process of compliance. The purpose of compliance is to
make the industry safe for consumers and to maintain the stability of the financial system. Compliance
does not involve operating within specific territories, organization plans, or different relationships.
</br></br></br>7. In general, a governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) software system identifies and measures risk;
monitors the risk-management system; routinely checks adherence to company-wide policies; and
ensures compliance with</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. reporting requirements.</opition><option>B. union demands.</opition><option>C. product standards.</opition><option>D. contingency plans.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: A. </br></br>Explanation: Demand for governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) software systems has
grown significantly in recent years. Although GRC software can be customized to better meet individual
business needs, it serves four basic functions. It identifies and measures corporate risk levels; monitors
the risk-management system; checks to see that employees are adhering to company-wide policies; and
ensures compliance with reporting requirements enforced by federal and state government agencies and
other regulatory commissions. It is not designed to ensure compliance with union demands, product
standards, or contingency plans.

Consumption. Everyone consumes goods and services to satisfy unlimited wants. Production, exchange,
and distribution are other economic activities. Production is the making or producing of goods and
services. Exchange involves the exchange of money payments between producers and the owners of
resources. Distribution examines how money payments are divided or distributed between resource
owners and producers.
</br></br></br>10. At work, Bob is assigned to be on a team of five people that will create a new product. Which action can
Bob take to participate in the team in a useful way?</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Keep the group on track by stopping others from offering unusual ideas</opition><option>B. Encourage the team to avoid setting ground rules</opition><option>C. Find out what other people in the group know about the product</opition><option>D. Walk around the room during discussions to keep energy in the group</opition></select></br></br>Correct: C. </br></br>Explanation: Starting a meeting by learning about
others' knowledge of the subject identifies what your team knowsâas well as areas where more work will
be needed. Some ground rules are needed to let everyone know how the group operates. Otherwise,
unacceptable behavior may occur. Unusual ideas should not be avoided. Often these are the
breakthroughs that lead to success. Bob should use good listening skills, including making eye contact
and using other nonverbal cues, to let others in the group know he is listening.
</br></br></br>11. Alma is preparing a presentation about her department's budget to make to the company president. She
wants to use a visual representation of the budget that shows parts in relation to the whole. Alma should
consider using a</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. table.</opition><option>B. pie chart.</opition><option>C. line graph.</opition><option>D. bar graph.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: B. </br></br>Explanation: If Alma wants to illustrate her budget by showing parts in relation to the whole, she should use
a pie chart. A table is a visual way of displaying information in rows and columns. A bar graph shows
values across categories. Line graphs usually depict information over time. Although Alma might want to
use these types of graphics for other parts of her presentation, the pie chart is the best way to show how
the parts of her budget add up to form the whole.
</br></br></br>12. What type of letter should a business include when sending copies of a contract to a vendor?</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A.

What is a type of informal communication that coworkers often use to communicate with each other?</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Network</opition><option>B. Feedback</opition><option>C. Grapevine</opition><option>D. Structured</opition></select></br></br>Correct: C. </br></br>Explanation: undefined</br></br></br>15. What is one of the benefits to a business of reinforcing service orientation through communication?</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Rewards customers for their support</opition><option>B. Promotes the sale of new products</opition><option>C. Builds positive relationships with customers</opition><option>D. Encourages employees to be aggressive</opition></select></br></br>Correct: C. </br></br>Explanation: A service orientation is the business philosophy of providing
quality service. One way to do this is to communicate effectively with customers so they trust the
business. The benefit of creating trust by providing accurate and credible information is that it tends to
build positive relationships with customers. Customers often remain loyal to a business if they have
confidence that the business will treat them well and provide quality service. The purpose of reinforcing
service orientation through communication is not to promote the sale of new products, reward customers
for their support, or encourage employees to be aggressive.
</br></br></br>16. When Mr. Schwarz's order did not arrive at the expected time, he called Karl, the salesperson with whom
he had placed his order. Karl apologized for the delay and told Mr. Schwarz that he would check into the
issue. After Karl talked with the transportation company, he immediately called Mr. Schwarz to let him
know where the order was and when to expect delivery. Mr. Schwarz thanked Karl for getting back with
him so quickly. In this situation, Karl reinforced the company's image by</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. delegating work tasks.</opition><option>B. giving vague answers.</opition><option>C. providing efficient follow-up.</opition><option>D. complimenting the customer.

</opition></select></br></br>Correct: C. </br></br>Explanation: Customers often base their impressions of a business on the interactions
they have with the business's employees. In the situation provided, Karl worked quickly to find out the
status of the order and immediately called Mr. Schwarz with specific information about where the order
was and when to expect delivery. This is an example of efficient follow-up. By providing efficient service,
Karl is building favorable relationships with customers. There is not enough information provided to
determine if Karl delegated work tasks to facilitate his follow-up activities or if he complimented Mr.
Schwarz.
</br></br></br>17. What is an important aspect of a customer-centric business?</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Reducing the number of touch points with customers</opition><option>B. Limiting the employees' decision making</opition><option>C. Being satisfied with the status quo</opition><option>D. Aligning business activities with customer needs</opition></select></br></br>Correct: D. </br></br>Explanation: A customer-centric business focuses on customer
needs and wants. To focus on the customers' needs and wants, the business must ensure that its
business objectives and activities align with its customers' needs and wants. A customer-centric business
must continuously improve its processes and products to accommodate its customers' changing needs
and wants. The business cannot be satisfied with the status quo. A customer-centric business allows its
employees to provide input and make decisions in relation to customer relationships. Touch points are all
of the opportunities that businesses have to connect with customers and reinforce their brand value. A
customer-centric business is not likely to reduce the number of customer touch points.
</br></br></br>18. When providing product information to clients, finance professionals should use</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. standard responses.</opition><option>B. technical terms.</opition><option>C. financial acronyms.</opition><option>D. simple explanations.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: D. </br></br>Explanation: When providing product information to clients, finance professionals should keep
the clients' point of view in mind. Clients may not be familiar with finance industry jargon, technical terms,
or acronyms. Therefore, finance professionals should use simple, clear language that clients understand.
While standard responses are sometimes helpful to finance professionals, it is usually better to keep
individual clients in mind when providing product information since different clients are likely to have
different knowledge bases.
</br></br></br>19. Beverly, the new office manager, just completed a review of the last two years of accounts receivable
data. In doing so, she discovered that there are erroneous duplicate entries totaling $25,628 in the
system. Unfortunately, due to these duplicate entries, collection letters were sent to many customers who
had already paid in fullâcustomers who are angry with the company for sending them the letters. What
should Beverly do to try to save these customer relationships and ensure that these customers are not
bothered in the future?</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Contact each customer by phone and apologize</opition><option>B. Complete an accounting software update</opition><option>C. Complete a data cleansing of the erroneous entries</opition><option>D. Use funds from the accounts payable account to pay the debt</opition></select></br></br>Correct: C. </br></br>Explanation: One of the quickest ways for a business to upset its
customers is to accuse them of failing to pay their billsâespecially when the business has already
received payment from them. To ensure that these customers do not receive more erroneous collection
letters in the future, Beverly should complete a data cleansing of the erroneous entries, removing them
from the system. Completing an accounting software update isn't likely to have an effect on the
erroneous entries. While it might be helpful to contact each customer by phone and apologize, Beverly
needs to do more than that to ensure that the customers are not bothered in the future. The $25,628 is
not a debt. It is the sum total of all the erroneous duplicate entries in the accounts receivable account.
</br></br></br>20. The process or activity of using goods is called</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. production.</opition><option>B. consumption.</opition><option>C. exchange.</opition><option>D. distribution.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: B. </br></br>Explanation: undefined</br></br></br>21. Which of the following is an example of a change in the relative price ratio when the original price of red
apples is $0.60 per pound and the original price of green apples is $0.80 per pound:</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Red apples @ $0.30 per pound; green apples @ $0.40 per pound</opition><option>B. Red apples @ $0.90 per pound; green apples @ $0.80 per pound</opition><option>C. Red apples @ $0.45 per pound; green apples @ $0.60 per pound</opition><option>D. Red apples @ $1.20 per pound; green apples @ $1.60 per pound</opition></select></br></br>Correct: B. </br></br>Explanation: This is the only combination that
resulted in a change in the relative price ratio. When red apples sold for $0.30 per pound and green
apples for $0.40 per pound, the price of each was cut in half, and the ratio remained the same. When red
apples sold for $1.20 per pound and green apples for $1.60 per pound, the price of each was doubled
and the ratio remained the same. When red apples sold for $0.45 per pound and green apples for $0.60,
the price of each was cut one-fourth, and the ratio remained the same.

Which of the following describes the matrix organizational structure:</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. It is a combination of two other organizational structures.</opition><option>B. It includes only traditional departments, such as sales and marketing.</opition><option>C. It is separated by product lines.</opition><option>D. It is the oldest organizational structure being used.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: A. </br></br>Explanation: The matrix organizational structure is a
combination of the functional structure and the divisional structure. It includes traditional departments, but
it is also broken down by division (including, but not limited to, product lines). As organizational design
goes, it is a newer, rather than older, structure.
</br></br></br>24. Seeing the big picture instead of smaller, individual parts is an organizational learning concept known as</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. systems thinking.</opition><option>B. team learning.</opition><option>C. shared organizational vision.</opition><option>D. personal mastery.

</opition></select></br></br>Correct: A. </br></br>Explanation: Systems thinking is an organizational learning concept that focuses on the big picture
rather than seeing smaller, individual parts. Team learning means thinking and working together as a
group. Shared organizational vision refers to sharing a mutual commitment to the future the firm seeks to
create. Personal mastery is striving for individual learning as a means of advancing the organization.
</br></br></br>25. The general economic growth of a country is supported by its</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. level of productivity.</opition><option>B. standard of living.</opition><option>C. gross domestic product.</opition><option>D. wealth of goods and services.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: A. </br></br>Explanation: The general economic growth of a country depends upon its level of productivity.
For example, the level of productivity in the United States has given the country a wealth of goods and
services which allows its citizens to reach a certain standard of living. Gross domestic product is the final,
total value of all goods and services produced within a country's geographic boundaries during a year's
time. GDP serves as a measure of economic growth.
</br></br></br>26. Colleen will vote next week on the new contract that her union has negotiated with management. Union
and management are in the __________ stage of the collective-bargaining process.</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. contract settlement</opition><option>B. ratification of contract</opition><option>C. preparation and research</opition><option>D. tentative agreement</opition></select></br></br>Correct: D. </br></br>Explanation: Tentative agreement is the stage at which union and management have agreed on
the terms of a contract but still need union members to approve or reject the contract. Preparation and
research occur before labor negotiations begin. A ratified contract is one that union members have
approved. Contract settlement occurs when a ratified contract has been signed by union and
management.
</br></br></br>27. An economy with a high unemployment level tends to have</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. rapid GDP growth.</opition><option>B. a high supply of money.</opition><option>C. fewer monetary policies.</opition><option>D. a lower rate of inflation.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: D. </br></br>Explanation: When a lot of people are out of work, they lose their buying power, which means
less money is in circulation. Because unemployed people have less disposable income, the demand for
goods and services is low, which tends to slow or lower the rate of inflation (rise in prices). The amount of
monetary policies that the government establishes does not affect unemployment rates. When the GDP
grows, an economic expansion is occurring, which indicates that people and businesses are spending
money and the unemployment levels are low.
</br></br></br>28. Jon decided to promote Bill instead of Maggie to regional manager because he thinks that women aren't
assertive enough in business situations. Jon is stereotyping on the basis of</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. age.</opition><option>B. ethnicity.</opition><option>C. religion.</opition><option>D. gender.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: D. </br></br>Explanation: undefined</br></br></br>29. One way that individuals exhibit self-confidence is by being</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. creative.</opition><option>B. enthusiastic.</opition><option>C. emotional.</opition><option>D. reserved.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: B. </br></br>Explanation: undefined</br></br></br>30. Maureen becomes angry and defensive whenever her supervisor asks Maureen to correct mistakes.
Maureen's attitude is not a good response to criticism because</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. it indicates that Maureen wants to call attention to herself.</opition><option>B. there is no reason to be angry about criticism.</opition><option>C. Maureen has no right to be angry on the job.</opition><option>D. it prevents Maureen from hearing the criticism clearly.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: D. </br></br>Explanation: Defensiveness raises a barrier between you and
the speaker. Most of us feel angry or resentful when we are criticized, especially when the criticism is
unjust. However, we cannot afford to exhibit this kind of attitude on the job. If Maureen listened with an
open mind to the supervisor, she might learn not only how to correct her mistakes but how to avoid the
mistakes in the future. Maureen's attitude indicates immaturity rather than a desire to call attention to
herself.
</br></br></br>31. Which of the following is an example of an employee respecting the privacy of a coworker:</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Speaking up for a coworker who is being unfairly criticized</opition><option>B. Leaving the room when a salesperson takes a telephone call</opition><option>C. Giving feedback about a project to a coworker or manager</opition><option>D. Answering a coworker's telephone when s/he is at lunch</opition></select></br></br>Correct: B. </br></br>Explanation: Successful employees realize the
importance of respecting others' privacy in the workplace. When employees respect others' privacy, they
are likely to gain the trust and respect of coworkers and managers. An employee who respects others'
privacy would leave the room when a coworker (e.g., salesperson) takes a telephone call. Speaking up
for a coworker, providing feedback, and answering a coworker's phone call are not necessarily situations
in which privacy is being violated; there is not enough information provided to determine if intervention
was requested.
</br></br></br>32. Barry's family is originally from Ireland. Their customs, habits, and traditions are known as their</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. stereotype.</opition><option>B. culture.</opition><option>C. diversity.</opition><option>D. religion.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: B. </br></br>Explanation: undefined</br></br></br>33.

</opition></select></br></br>Correct: A. </br></br>Explanation: Insecure people are often anxious about their interpersonal relationships.
They are afraid if they become assertive, they may ruin a friendship or end a relationship. Assertiveness
is a risk they are unwilling to take. These people are dependent rather than independent and may
already be considered childish because of their passive behavior that focuses on pleasing others.
</br></br></br>34. Keeping the end goal in mind refers to which standard of excellence that achievement-oriented people
set?</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Results</opition><option>B. Improvement</opition><option>C. Trying something new</opition><option>D. Competition</opition></select></br></br>Correct: A. </br></br>Explanation: undefined</br></br></br>35. One way a leader can encourage others to work toward a shared vision is by</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. guaranteeing a profit for the business.</opition><option>B. describing the objective.</opition><option>C. reviewing the new assignment.</opition><option>D. explaining how they will benefit.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: D. </br></br>Explanation: People tend to work harder to achieve a vision or goal if they understand
how they will benefit. Therefore, a leader should explain the benefits they will receive so employees will
be encouraged to work toward a shared vision. Simply describing the objective or reviewing the new
assignment will not encourage employees to work unless they also understand how they will benefit.
Generating a profit is a benefit to the business that will not necessarily encourage employees to work
unless they will share in the profit.
</br></br></br>36. Coaching is mostly about</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. talking.</opition><option>B. organizing.</opition><option>C. instructing.</opition><option>D. listening.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: D. </br></br>Explanation: undefined</br></br></br>37. Which of the following people would make the best entrepreneur:</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. A risk-averse person who wants to work 9-to-5</opition><option>B. A person who lacks self-confidence</opition><option>C. A risk-taker who has a strong work ethic</opition><option>D. A person who often works so hard she makes herself sick</opition></select></br></br>Correct: C. </br></br>Explanation: Entrepreneurship requires risk-taking, a strong work ethic, and
self-confidence. It often requires working much longer hours than 9-to-5. Entrepreneurs must work hard,
but they are also in charge of protecting their own health. Getting sick means missing work and losing
money.
</br></br></br>38. When the U.S. federal government owes money to a contracted employee or business, the government

There are no U.S. legal requirements for financial exchange called "Early Bird," "Secure Contracting," or
"Government Guidelines."

services. Exchange involves the exchange of money payments between producers and the owners of
resources. Distribution examines how money payments are divided or distributed between resource
owners and producers.
</br></br></br>40. The key factors involved in compounding growth are the amount of money you invest, how much your
investment grows each year, and</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. your educational background and career.</opition><option>B. how you earn the money that you invest.</opition><option>C. how long your money is invested.</opition><option>D. your mutual fund manager's education.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: C. </br></br>Explanation: The most important factors to consider in compounding growth are
how much money you invest, how much your investment grows each year, and how long your money is
invested. Investing is using money to make money, which means that if you invest money in the stock
market, for example, you are likely to make an average of 10 percent each year. As the years pass, your
investment will grow tremendously because you will be earning interest on interest. So, it is beneficial to
invest for as long as possible to earn the largest amount of compound interest as possible. How you earn
the money that you invest, your educational background and career, and your mutual fund manager's
education have a much smaller impact on compounding growth than time does.

Advise the proper law enforcement authorities about the loss</opition><option>B. Contact the appropriate government agency to replace the credit cards</opition><option>C. Cancel all of his credit and debit cards</opition><option>D. Change the passwords for his online banking accounts</opition></select></br></br>Correct: C. </br></br>Explanation: Identity theft occurs when somebody uses another individual's
name and personal information (e.g. credit cards) for fraudulent purposes. The first thing Cameron
should do when he realizes he has lost his wallet is to cancel his credit cards. By canceling the credit
cards, Cameron will protect himself in the event that someone finds his wallet and attempts to use the
credit cards. Financial institutions and businesses (e.g., retailers) issue credit cards, not government
agencies. Cameron should contact the proper law enforcement authorities (e.g., police) if he thinks his
wallet is stolen. He can report a lost wallet, and he can also change the passwords for his online banking
accounts. However, the first thing he should do is to cancel his credit and debit cards.

</opition></select></br></br>Correct: B. </br></br>Explanation: Deposit-taking financial institutions
accept funds from customers (depositors) and pay interest on the funds. Credit unions, commercial
banks, savings and loan associations (banks), and mutual savings banks are types of deposit-taking
financial institutions. A corporation is a form of business ownership that is owned by stockholders who
have purchased units or shares of the company. Brokerages are financial intermediaries that sell
securities. Insurance firms sell insurance and securities. Corporations, brokerages, and insurance firms
are not types of deposit-taking financial institutions.

Corporate bonds and treasury bills</opition><option>B. Common stock and certificates of deposit</opition><option>C. Treasury bills and certificates of deposit</opition><option>D. Corporate bonds and preferred stock</opition></select></br></br>Correct: D. </br></br>Explanation: Capital markets buy and sell long-term securities. Corporate
bonds, common and preferred stock, and treasury bonds are examples of securities that are sold on
capital markets. Treasury bills and certificates of deposit are money market securities, which are shortterm securities.
</br></br></br>44. Supervised by the Federal Reserve Board, The DAB Company provides investment advisory services,
insurance underwriting, securities underwriting, and merchant banking services. What does the DAB
Company exemplify?</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. An accounting firm</opition><option>B. A financial holding company</opition><option>C. A central bank</opition><option>D. A commodities investor</opition></select></br></br>Correct: B. </br></br>Explanation: Because financial holding companies provide a wide variety of financial
services and related products, the Federal Reserve Board supervises their activities. The primary
services that an accounting firm provides include accounting, tax preparation, auditing, and bookkeeping
services. Some financial holding companies may offer accounting services. Commodities investors invest
their funds in goods (futures) such as grains, livestock, raw materials, etc. A central bank is often
responsible for determining interest rates, controlling the nation's money supply, and regulating the
banking industry. The Federal Reserve is an example of a central bank.
</br></br></br>45. According to most analysts, the three economic indicators that stock market investors and traders should
pay the closest attention to are</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. inflation, unemployment, and bonds rates.</opition><option>B. interest rates, overhead expenses, and inflation.</opition><option>C. Gross Domestic Product, overhead expenses, and unemployment.</opition><option>D. Gross Domestic Product, unemployment, and inflation.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: D. </br></br>Explanation: According to most analysts, the three economic
indicators that impact the stock market the most (and, therefore, the three that stock market investors
and traders should pay the closest attention to) are the Gross Domestic Product, unemployment, and
inflation. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the final market value of the total output of all goods and
services produced within a country's geographic boundaries during a year's time. The stock market
mirrors the GDPâif the GDP goes up, the stock market usually goes up with it. The unemployment rate
is the percentage of the workforce that is unemployed. The stock market is inversely related to the
unemployment rateâif the unemployment rate goes up, stock prices usually go down. Inflation is a rapid
rise in prices that may occur when demand exceeds supply or when productivity declines and costs of
labor go up. If inflation and interest rates both rise, the stock market will suffer. However, if inflation goes
up while interest rates stay low, the stock market is likely to benefit. Overhead expenses and bond rates
are not economic indicators.

What type of financial statement includes an accounting of the shareholders' equity for a company?</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Annual report</opition><option>B. Income statement</opition><option>C. Cash flow statement</opition><option>D. Balance sheet</opition></select></br></br>Correct: D. </br></br>Explanation: The balance sheet gives a summary of a company's financial health at a specific point in
time. It contains two major sections: a listing of the company's assets and a listing of its liabilities. The
liabilities section also indicates the shareholders' equity, which is the value of all the outstanding stock
owned by shareholders. Shareholders' equity is determined by subtracting the liabilities from the assets.
The income statement, also known as the profit-and-loss statement, shows a company's profitability over
a specific period of time. The cash flow statement tracks the money that comes into and flows out of a
company. An annual report is not a type of financial statement, but it does contain financial statements,
along with a good deal of other information about the company.

apples for $0.40 per pound, the price of each was cut in half, and the ratio remained the same. When red
apples sold for $1.20 per pound and green apples for $1.60 per pound, the price of each was doubled
and the ratio remained the same. When red apples sold for $0.45 per pound and green apples for $0.60,
the price of each was cut one-fourth, and the ratio remained the same.

Test 1123

</opition></select></br></br>Correct: A. </br></br>Explanation: The technology of electronic funds transfer makes it possible for customers to pay
invoices electronically so the cash is transferred from their bank account to the business's bank account.
This eliminates the need for the business to handle checks, fill out deposit slips, and send the checks to
the bank for processing. The cash is available immediately, and the business does not need to wait for a
check to be processed before it can access the funds. The use of electronic funds transfer to collect
accounts receivable does not eliminate liquidity reporting, sales discounting, or payee outsourcing.
</br></br></br>51. A business's balance sheet lists $3,800 in cash, $15,125 in accounts payable, $2,775 in taxes, $10,350

When preparing a statement of equity, what does a business deduct from its total net income to obtain its
retained earnings?</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Bad debt</opition><option>B. Depreciation of assets</opition><option>C. Sales tax payable</opition><option>D. Dividends paid</opition></select></br></br>Correct: D. </br></br>Explanation: Retained earnings are the income that a corporation keeps after paying dividends to its
stockholders. This amount, which includes any forwarding balance of retained earnings from the previous
accounting period, is reported on the company's statement of equity, which is also called the statement of
retained earnings. The depreciation of assets, sales tax payable, and bad or uncollectible debt are not
included on the statement of equity.
</br></br></br>53. A characteristic of managerial accounting is that it focuses on</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. reporting the business's long-term investment goals.</opition><option>B. capturing the business's day-to-day financial activities.</opition><option>C. developing the business's annual report.</opition><option>D. preparing and submitting the business's tax forms.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: B. </br></br>Explanation: Accounting is the process of keeping and
interpreting financial records. Managerial accounting primarily focuses on capturing, maintaining, and
interpreting the business's accounting information for internal use and decision making. Managerial
accounting often summarizes information about the business's day-to-day financial activities, such as
sales transactions (accounts receivable) and the monies the business owes others (accounts payable).
Financial accounting focuses on capturing, maintaining, preparing, and reporting financial information to
external audiences. Examples of financial accounting activities include preparing tax data for the
government and developing the annual report for the business's stakeholders. The annual report usually
contains information about the business's long-term investment goals.
</br></br></br>54. A company purchases an expensive new software system and divides the cost of it between the two
departments that will use the system.

When a business has been running successfully for several years, what would be a probable next
financial step?</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Acquiring start-up funds</opition><option>B. Purchasing a second location</opition><option>C. Deciding on financial goals</opition><option>D. Determining product prices</opition></select></br></br>Correct: B. </br></br>Explanation: If a business has been running successfully for several years, it may be in
the expansion stage of its lifecycle. This could mean that the company would consider purchasing a
second location. The company would acquire start-up funds, decide on financial goals, and determine
product prices at a much earlier stage in development.
</br></br></br>56. A small restaurant wants to expand, but first it needs to raise funds. John wants to raise capital through
debt financing, but his partner, Damien, isn't sure that's a good idea. What is one downside of debt
financing that Damien could cite to prove his point to John?</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. They will need to sell stock in their business.</opition><option>B. Shareholders will own part of their business.</opition><option>C. They will have to pay interest on the borrowed amount.</opition><option>D. They will be required to repay the money immediately.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: C. </br></br>Explanation: A downside of acquiring capital through debt
financing is that the borrower must pay interest on the money borrowed. This means that John and
Damien will end up owing more than the amount of money they initially borrowed. In equity financing,
stocks are sold to shareholders and those shareholders own a stake in the company. Damien and John
would not be required to repay the money immediately.
</br></br></br>57. Ethan is developing common-size financial statements so that he can compare financial performance

</opition></select></br></br>Correct: A. </br></br>Explanation: A balance sheet is a financial statement that captures the financial
condition of the business at that particular moment. Three main elements are included on the balance
sheetâassets, liabilities, and owner's equity. Available cash is one part of the business's total assets. If
the assets do not equal the liabilities when the liabilities are added to the owner's equity (Assets =
Liabilities + Owner's Equity), information on the balance sheet is incorrect.

Effective financial-information management involves implementing processes that help companies</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. revise economic indicators.</opition><option>B. track their ongoing projects.</opition><option>C. interpret government regulations.</opition><option>D. make appropriate business decisions.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: D. </br></br>Explanation: Businesses track a variety of accounting and financial data. The
data are presented as information to businesspeople to evaluate and to make business decisions. In
order for businesspeople to make sound business decisions, the financial data must be accurate, current,
and relevant. Making a decision based on incorrect or outdated data could be very costly to a business.
Businesses use project-management software to track projects. Businesses implement effective
financial-information management processes to be in compliance with government regulations.
Businesses evaluate, rather than revise, economic indicators.
</br></br></br>61. Which of the following is an example of a businessperson exhibiting unethical behavior in relation to a
business's financial information:</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. A banker requests financial information from a business to process a loan.</opition><option>B. An auditor verifies the accuracy of a corporation's financial statements.</opition><option>C. An unauthorized employee reviews a client's financial information.</opition><option>D. A manager examines the business's financial records to develop a budget.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: C. </br></br>Explanation: Businesses have an ethical duty to
protect their clients' financial information. Businesses must develop and implement procedures that
reduce the risk of theft or unauthorized access to confidential financial information by internal and
external sources. Verifying the accuracy of financial statements, requesting financial information to
process a loan, and examining financial records to develop a budget are necessary and ethical practices.
</br></br></br>62. The foundation of the principle of least authority is that computer data are more secure when access to
specific types of data are only available to</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. the customers who request it.</opition><option>B. mid-level managers.</opition><option>C. personnel during set time periods.</opition><option>D. the people who need it.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: D. </br></br>Explanation: By limiting access to those who use or need it, confidential data are more secure
and are less likely to be seen or modified by unauthorized people. Computer passwords are common
methods of limiting access to certain computer data. Top-level management usually develops or
approves the policies that determine who can access certain data. Mid-level managers usually need
access to certain types of business data, but not all of it. Customers are often able to access some data
about their personal accounts online.
</br></br></br>63. Tara knows that for her small business to grow, she must increase her cash flow. She's unsure, though,
whether she should take out a loan or a line of credit. Which of the following budgeting software tools
could Tara use to assess the potential impact of each source of funding on her business:</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Zero-based modeling</opition><option>B. Decision trees</opition><option>C. Environmental scanning</opition><option>D. Debt modeling</opition></select></br></br>Correct: D. </br></br>Explanation: Some budgeting software applications include a debt modeling tool which allows the user
to assess the potential impact of loans and lines of credit. To use the debt modeling tool, the user would
input the terms of the loan or line of credit, including the interest rate, term, principal, etc. Decision trees
are a data-mining technique commonly used to classify data and build models. Environmental scanning
involves gathering information about the environment surrounding a business, analyzing that information,
and determining the future impact of that information on the business. Zero-based budgeting is a method
of budgeting that requires a manager to demonstrate the need for every expense instead of relying on
figures from a previous period.

intangible business property. Federal law protects a business's intangible property from being used by
competitors. A business's inventory, acreage, and equipment are types of tangible property.

Before approving a loan application, a bank is likely to analyze the applicant's</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. inflation rate.</opition><option>B. debt ratio.</opition><option>C. brand preferences.</opition><option>D. performance goals.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: B. </br></br>Explanation: When red apples sold for $0.30 per pound and green
apples for $0.40 per pound, the price of each was cut in half, and the ratio remained the same. When red
apples sold for $1.20 per pound and green apples for $1.60 per pound, the price of each was doubled
and the ratio remained the same. When red apples sold for $0.45 per pound and green apples for $0.60,
the price of each was cut one-fourth, and the ratio remained the same.

</opition></select></br></br>Correct: C. </br></br>Explanation: The first task in the HR management activity of staffing is determining need. A
company cannot fill job positions with appropriate employees until it knows exactly where human
resources are lacking. Determining job descriptions, recruiting, and screening and selecting applicants
are all staffing activities that occur after need has been determined.
</br></br></br>67. Business customers differ from final consumers in that</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. there is a greater emphasis on personal selling in business-to-business marketing.</opition><option>B. business customers don't care about service as much as consumers do.</opition><option>C. consumers tend to buy in bulk more often than businesses do.</opition><option>D. consumer products tend to be more technical in nature.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: A. </br></br>Explanation: In consumer
marketing, the emphasis is on promotion and advertising; in B2B marketing, however, there is a greater
emphasis on personal selling. Businesses tend to buy products that are more technical in nature than
consumer products. Businesses also tend to buy in bulk more than individual consumers do. Both
business customers and individual consumers care about service, but it tends to be more important to
businesses.
</br></br></br>68. Amy says, "I think the primary reason that last year's sales were higher than this year's sales is because
Jansen Electronics has taken a portion of our market share." This is an example of</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. comparative criticism.</opition><option>B. a fact.</opition><option>C. historical data.</opition><option>D. an opinion.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: D. </br></br>Explanation: An opinion is a person's point of view or belief about a topic. Amy is stating her opinion about
why sales varied from one year to another. Her opinion may be supported by facts (true data), but she
isn't presenting any dataâcurrent or historicalâin her statement. There isn't enough information
provided to determine if Amy is stating her opinion as criticism, which involves expressing disapproval.
</br></br></br>69. What do most businesses use to store information for future use?</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Scanners</opition><option>B. Display screens</opition><option>C. Computer systems</opition><option>D. Firewalls</opition></select></br></br>Correct: C. </br></br>Explanation: Computer systems consist of the hardware and software components that enable
computers to function. One of their purposes is to store information for future use. Scanners are input
devices that can read text or illustrations on paper and translate the information into a form the computer
can use. The scanner itself does not store information, but enables computers to store it. Display
screens, or monitors, display the characters being keyed into the computer; they are not storage devices.
Firewalls protect a business's computer system from unauthorized use by others (e.g., hackers).
</br></br></br>70. Adian is conducting online research for a marketing project at work. What web-based tool will help Adian
save and organize the websites that contain the relevant information he needs for his final report?</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Personal intranet connection</opition><option>B. Notebook with color-coded dividers</opition><option>C. Word-processing memo template</opition><option>D. Browser bookmarking applications</opition></select></br></br>Correct: D. </br></br>Explanation: Browsers are computer software that retrieve information from the
World Wide Web. Browsers have bookmarking applications that allow computer users to select websites
and store their URLs on a personal computer for easy access in the future. Bookmarking applications
allow users to organize sites by categories by placing them into folders on a computer. Notebooks are
not online tools. An intranet is an internal network similar to the Internet that is accessible only by
authorized employees. A word-processing memo template formats a type of written message.
</br></br></br>71. In which of the following situations would a business use a spreadsheet software program to estimate the
effect of change on its financial situation:</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. A salesperson kept all appointments.</opition><option>B. Mailing labels are needed for a catalog.</opition><option>C. Customers purchased more products.</opition><option>D. Sales are expected to increase by 5%.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: D. </br></br>Explanation: Spreadsheet software programs allow businesses to use a
computer to perform accounting and other financial calculations. An advantage of using a spreadsheet
program is that a business can make various assumptions about sales and find out quickly what effect
they will have on its financial situation. For example, a business could change the level of sales by
different percentages, such as 5% or 10%, to find out the effect that would have on net income. The
spreadsheet program automatically does the calculations. Although keeping appointments might lead to
sales, a salesperson would likely not use a spreadsheet program to track appointments. Mailing labels
are generated with database programs. Database programs are also used to track customers'
purchases.
</br></br></br>72. What application enables a business to identify when a record was added to a database?</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Validation rules</opition><option>B. Date/Time stamp</opition><option>C. Data replication</opition><option>D. Sort</opition></select></br></br>Correct: B. </br></br>Explanation: The date/time stamp enables a business to identify the date and time that a particular
record was added to the database. This can help a business track employees' keying activities and track
when customers are added to the database. The validation-rules application enables a database
developer to restrict how and/or what data can be keyed in a particular database field. The data
replication application involves copying data from one database to another. This enables users to access
the data they need to perform their tasks without interfering with others' work. The sort application
enables users to view only the data they need to view, such as orders placed on a particular date.
</br></br></br>73. The primary purpose for record keeping is to provide information about what is happening with the</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. industry.</opition><option>B. country.</opition><option>C. economy.</opition><option>D. business.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: D. </br></br>Explanation: undefined</br></br></br>74. Which of the following is an example of how a business or industry has a unique relationship with its
environment:</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Social and cultural attitudes change over time.</opition><option>B. An economy in prosperity will eventually experience recession.</opition><option>C. Demand for skilled nursing care rises as the population ages.</opition><option>D. New technology causes new laws to be enacted.

</opition></select></br></br>Correct: C. </br></br>Explanation: The impact of demographics (the age of
the population) on a specific industry (health care) shows that businesses have unique relationships with
their environments. The aging of the population affects other industries, but perhaps not as directly as it
does health care. An economy phasing through the business cycle and a shift in social/cultural attitudes
are examples of how environmental factors are dynamic. New technology causing new laws to be
enacted is an example of how environmental factors are interrelated.
</br></br></br>75. Determine the mode for a customer-survey question using the following statistical information: 7, 5, 3, 7,
7, 9, 5, 7, 9, 9</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. 5</opition><option>B. 3</opition><option>C. 7</opition><option>D. 9</opition></select></br></br>Correct: T. </br></br>Explanation: undefined</br></br></br>76. Which of the following statements is true of workplace accidents:</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Accidents only occur in factories.</opition><option>B. All accidents can be predicted.</opition><option>C. There is no way to prepare for accidents.</opition><option>D. There are ways to reduce accident risk.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: D. </br></br>Explanation: Although you can't prevent every accident from happening, there
are things your company can (and should!) do to reduce accident risk. For example, to minimize trips and
falls you should keep all floors clean, mop up spills, and make sure that ice outdoors is treated or
removed. Workplace accidents cannot be predictedâthey can happen to anyone at any time. Although
you cannot predict accidents, you can prepare for them by having an accident plan in place. Accidents
can occur at any workplace, not just in factories.
</br></br></br>77. Which of the following is a common challenge for project managers:</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Laws and regulations</opition><option>B. Poorly defined goals</opition><option>C. A surplus of resources</opition><option>D. A lack of risk</opition></select></br></br>Correct: B. </br></br>Explanation: Poorly defined project goals are one of the many challenges that project managers
routinely face. A surplus of resources would be a good thing, as would a lack of risk! Laws and
regulations may affect business projects, but they typically don't pose a challenge.
</br></br></br>78. What project-planning tool helps businesses to effectively plan and use time?</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Policies</opition><option>B. Objectives</opition><option>C. Schedules</opition><option>D. Guidelines</opition></select></br></br>Correct: C. </br></br>Explanation: undefined</br></br></br>79. Which of the following is NOT a benefit of a post-implementation review?</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Identifying ways to improve project planning</opition><option>B. Identifying cost-savings opportunities for future projects</opition><option>C. Identifying cost-savings opportunities for the current project</opition><option>D. Identifying ways to improve the company's processes</opition></select></br></br>Correct: C. </br></br>Explanation: A post-implementation review is conducted
after a project is finished. Therefore, there is not an opportunity to save money on the current project.
There is an opportunity to identify ways to improve future projects, such as cost-savings measures,
improving project planning methods, and improving the processes used by the company.
</br></br></br>80. Purchasing is important to international businesses because</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. supplies should be delivered in a timely fashion.</opition><option>B. good relations with vendors reduce prices.</opition><option>C. quality standards should be maintained.</opition><option>D. controlling costs increases competitiveness.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: A. </br></br>Explanation: undefined</br></br></br>81. An advantage to businesses of using quality control methods is that these methods often</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. involve time.</opition><option>B. reduce costs.</opition><option>C. increase waste.</opition><option>D. require directions.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: B. </br></br>Explanation: It is often more costly not to provide quality than to use methods to increase quality. If
businesses develop a reputation of providing low quality goods and services, they may lose customers,
which is costly. Therefore, it is to the business's advantage to use quality control methods so the work
will be done correctly rather than spend money to correct mistakes, handle customer complaints, and find
new customers. Using quality control methods involves time, but it is time well spent to reduce the cost of
correcting mistakes. Using quality control methods usually decreases waste. Some quality control
methods might require directions which could be a disadvantage.
</br></br></br>82. An organization with a quality culture would have executive-level managers who are</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. flexible, indifferent, and not responsible for quality.</opition><option>B. good at delegating all commitments for quality assurance.</opition><option>C. committed and involved and take responsibility for quality.</opition><option>D. able to enlist the expertise of outside contractors for quality.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: C. </br></br>Explanation: Executive-level managers are both committed
and involved. They take responsibility for quality and do not delegate that responsibility. This is a
characteristic shared by organizations with a quality culture. The alternatives remove the responsibility for
quality from the executive-level manager and delegate it to others.
</br></br></br>83. Joan achieved her goal of being a junior partner in five years. This achievement has made Joan feel
good about herself, so she has set a new goal to be a senior partner in 10 years. Joan has received
which of the following benefits of goal setting:</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Helps you to understand yourself</opition><option>B. Gives you a way to measure your progress</opition><option>C. Helps you to stay on task</opition><option>D. Raises your level of self-esteem

</opition></select></br></br>Correct: D. </br></br>Explanation: undefined</br></br></br>84. Recognizing your strengths and weaknesses helps you to accept yourself, which is one of the
foundations of</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. safety.</opition><option>B. social acceptance.</opition><option>C. self-esteem.</opition><option>D. self-fulfillment.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: C. </br></br>Explanation: undefined</br></br></br>85. Diana prepares bills and invoices for her company. Her career is in the area of</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. marketing communications.</opition><option>B. corporate finance.</opition><option>C. securities and investments.</opition><option>D. professional selling.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: B. </br></br>Explanation: Diana's job preparing bills and invoices for her company is in the area of corporate
finance. The corporate finance function in a company is to manage policy and strategy for (and the
implementation of) capital structure, budgeting, acquisition and investment, financial modeling and
planning, funding, dividends, and taxation. Diana's career is not in the area of marketing
communications, securities and investments, or professional selling. Marketing communications involves
marketing activities that inform, remind, and/or persuade the targeted audience of ideas, experiences,
goods/services, and/or images. The securities and investments industry consists of brokerage firms,
investment banks, and stock exchanges, all of which support the flow of funds from investors to
companies and institutions. Careers in professional selling involve marketing and management activities
that determine customer needs/wants and respond through planned, personalized communication to
influence purchase decisions and enhance future business operations.
</br></br></br>86. Some job application forms ask why the applicant left a previous job. Which of the following would be an
acceptable answer to this question:</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. "I was expected to do too much work."</opition><option>B. "I was seeking a more responsible job."</opition><option>C. "I couldn't get along with my supervisor."</opition><option>D. "I wanted to get out of a difficult situation."</opition></select></br></br>Correct: B. </br></br>Explanation: This is a positive response which indicates that the applicant is
interested in getting ahead and is willing to accept additional responsibility. A job applicant should not
make negative remarks about his/her previous employer(s) or coworkers. Even though all of the other
alternatives could be true statements, they are negative and will reflect poorly on the job applicant.
</br></br></br>87. Bobbi, who works for an insurance company, is responsible for calculating the risk of loss, establishing
premium rates, and designing insurance policies to cover risk. Bobbi works as a(n)</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. underwriter.</opition><option>B. agent.</opition><option>C. accountant.</opition><option>D. financial analyst.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: A. </br></br>Explanation: undefined</br></br></br>88. Corporate governance is primarily concerned with __________ desires.</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. vendors'</opition><option>B. CEO's</opition><option>C. stakeholders'</opition><option>D. competitors'</opition></select></br></br>Correct: C. </br></br>Explanation: undefined</br></br></br>89. Which of the following is a benefit of corporate governance:</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. It encourages transparency.</opition><option>B. It decreases investor confidence.</opition><option>C. It creates a less definable brand.</opition><option>D. It maximizes corruption.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: A. </br></br>Explanation: Corporate governance creates a more transparent business environment,
which can increase investor confidence, create a defined brand, and minimize corruption.
</br></br></br>90. Which of the following is a positive characteristic for the members of a corporation's board of directors to
possess:</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Independent thinking</opition><option>B. Conformity</opition><option>C. Indecisiveness</opition><option>D. Single-minded attitude</opition></select></br></br>Correct: A. </br></br>Explanation: Systems thinking is an organizational learning concept that focuses on the big picture
rather than seeing smaller, individual parts. Team learning means thinking and working together as a
group. Shared organizational vision refers to sharing a mutual commitment to the future the firm seeks to
create. Personal mastery is striving for individual learning as a means of advancing the organization.
</br></br></br>91. Which employee reports directly to a corporation's board of directors?</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Chief executive officer</opition><option>B. Accounting manager</opition><option>C. Vice president of operations</opition><option>D. Director of sales

12
</opition></select></br></br>Correct: A. </br></br>Explanation: The board of directors is the group of people chosen to govern the activities of a
corporation. The board members are elected by the corporation's shareholders. The corporation's chief
executive officer (CEO) reports directly to the board of directors. The vice president of operations is most
likely to report to the CEO. The accounting manager and director of marketing are mid-level managers.
The accounting manager is most likely to report to the vice president of finance, and the director of sales
is most likely to report to the vice president of marketing.
</br></br></br>92. Ryan is a college student who is interested in becoming a teacher. Every Tuesday afternoon, he spends
his free time tutoring second-grade students in reading and math at a local elementary school. What
technique is Ryan using to obtain work experience?</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Volunteering</opition><option>B. Informational interview</opition><option>C.

Is the following statement about trade associations and professional organizations true or false: Once a
law has been enacted, organizations/associations are unable to affect the way that law will be enforced.</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. True, members of organizations/associations have no way of influencing the enforcement of
laws.</opition><option>B. False, there are exceptions that apply to every law.</opition><option>C. False, organizations/associations often can change unfavorable regulations to more favorable
ones.</opition><option>D. True, laws cannot be changed and must be obeyed.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: C. </br></br>Explanation: undefined</br></br></br>94. One way to build professional relationships in the finance industry is to</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. encourage others to discuss their finances.</opition><option>B. read about industry trends.</opition><option>C. implement a referral system.</opition><option>D. print new business cards for distribution.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: C. </br></br>Explanation: A referral is a recommendation given to an individual or business by
another individual or business. For example, satisfied clients may refer their friends, family, or colleagues
to their financial planners for financial advice. This is one way that businesspeople working in the
financial industry can build professional relationships. A financial planner may implement a referral
system or program to encourage clients or associates to provide referrals. A referral system might involve
giving a free consultation or discount to a client who has provided the financial planner with a lucrative
referral. Reading about industry trends and printing new business cards are not actions that build
professional relationships. The finance professional must take action on the trends s/he has researched
and distribute the business cards to others to begin building professional relationships. Because financial
information is personal and confidential, people are usually selective with whom they share their
information.
</br></br></br>95. To manage potential risks resulting from unethical conduct, many companies build internal infrastructures
that promote and enforce ethical practices. This internal infrastructure is likely to include appropriate audit
procedures, a code of conduct, and a __________ policy.</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. whistleblower</opition><option>B. credit</opition><option>C. monetary</opition><option>D. constituent</opition></select></br></br>Correct: A. </br></br>Explanation: undefined</br></br></br>96. Many computer software programs help businesses determine their levels of business risk, which is
helpful when they develop</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. monetary regulations.</opition><option>B. content theories.</opition><option>C. endorsement records.</opition><option>D. contingency plans.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: D. </br></br>Explanation: A contingency plan is an alternative course of action. A contingency plan states
specific guidelines that a business uses when responding to undesirable circumstances. Businesses
often use computer software programs to obtain numerical data about their levels of risk in different areas
of the business. They use this information to make business decisions and to help them develop
alternative action plans when circumstances occur that increase or decrease risk at a given time. Content
theories are theories of motivation that focus on internal needs, drives, and incentives that cause people
to behave in a certain manner. An endorsement is approval by a reputable external source. Governments
develop monetary and fiscal regulations. Risk management software programs do not help businesses
develop content theories, endorsement records, and fiscal policies.
</br></br></br>97. How does forming a captive insurance company typically impact a corporation's federal tax liability?</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. Reduces tax due on the captive's premiums</opition><option>B. Increases tax due on the captive's loss reserves</opition><option>C. Increases the corporation's sales tax liabilities</opition><option>D. Eliminates the corporation's state tax liabilities</opition></select></br></br>Correct: A. </br></br>Explanation: Even if it is not associated with an insurance company, an
individual company, industry, or association may create a captive insurance company to specifically
protect its parent group(s). The captive insurer aids its parent group(s) by reducing premium expenses,
freeing up capital, and covering risks not commonly addressed by the greater insurance company. In
addition, forming a captive insurance company can reduce, eliminate, or defer federal taxes due on the
corporation's insurance premiums. A captive insurer typically decreases the tax due on a company's loss
reserves. Forming a captive insurance company does not typically increase the corporation's sales tax
liabilities, nor does it eliminate the corporation's state tax liabilities.
</br></br></br>98. To control online transactional risks, a business should consider outsourcing its technology needs when it
lacks</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. internal expertise.</opition><option>B. financial resources.</opition><option>C. secondary data.</opition><option>D. external training.</opition></select></br></br>Correct: A. </br></br>Explanation: An important aspect of controlling online risk is making sure that customers'
transactions are secure. Online transactions require customers to provide confidential information (e.g.
credit card numbers), so businesses must have the technological tools and expertise to prevent
unauthorized access to the information. If a business does not have employees with the expertise to work
with this technology, the business should consider hiring a consultant or firm that has the knowledge and
training to handle its technological needs. Outsourcing requires a business to have the money (financial
resources) to pay for the services. Secondary data are facts and figures that have been collected for
purposes other than the project at hand.
</br></br></br>99. It is important for companies to practice enterprise risk management (ERM) because</br></br><select><option disabled selected>Select</option><option>A. most risks are predictable and manageable.</opition><option>B. it leads to loss of shareholder value.</opition><option>C. most risks are unexpected.</opition><option>D. it increases business costs in the long run.

</opition></select></br></br>Correct: A. </br></br>Explanation: Enterprise risk management is important and helpful
because most business risks are predictable and manageable. If a company can plan for risks, it can
minimize its losses. Although some risks are surprises, most of them are not. Not managing risks can
cause loss of shareholder value. ERM should reduce business costs in the long run by helping a
business avoid or manage risks that could lose money.
