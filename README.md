# DECA-Web-App

A web application to solve many of the problems at my high school DECA club, including parsed online exams, secure registration and authentication, user-specific announcements, and more.

# Parsing
Created a script [here](https://github.com/IbrahimIrfan/exam-parser) to parse poorly formatted PDF practice exams and output self marking online forms.

# Registration
Secure registration is implemented with PHP using sha256 hashing and salts.

# Admin Access
Executives can track user exam scores, post announcements to their cluster with email notifications, and manage resources.

# Resources
Resources for each event are available under "Events".
